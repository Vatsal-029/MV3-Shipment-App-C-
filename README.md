About MV3
<p>MV3 Shipmemt Tracking Application acts as an aggrigator that validates shipment ID from various carriers and presents the information to the user (shipper/ recipient) on entering a valid package ID. MV3 started its operations in 2019 by providing messages to the users by updating them about their parcel at each stage, however we started our web based services in 2022 after realizing the potential the web based application would provide to us and our stakeholders <p/>

About The Project
<p>This project is a part of the group assignment for the IT Business Analysis Course at Cambrian College. The project focuses on developing a web based application that is written in C# programming language. It also aims to follow the CRUD module, and expects the application to get connected on Azure cloud service for data referencing. In this assignment, we have tried to cover as many modules as possible and tried to make the application functional factoring the time alloted. Further development on this project can be expected. <p/>
